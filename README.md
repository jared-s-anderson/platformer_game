# Overview

As a software engineer, working on this project helped me to become more familiar with Python and Pygame. Before working on a 
platformer game, I did not have much experience working with Pygame. After taking the time to work on a platformer game in
Python, I have become more familiar with both of them.

The type of game that I created is a platformer. The game is played using the arrow keys and the space bar. The left and right keys are used for movement, and the space bar is used for jumping.

My main reason for writing this software was so that I felt more comfortable working with Pygame.

A demonstration of how I created the game can be found below.

# Development Environment

I developed a platforming game using a software called Tiled. Tiled gave me the ability create a map using sprites and images.

For this game, I decided to use Python and Pygame. My maps that were created in Tiled were saved in a CSV format, so I used a CSV reader libary.

# Future Work

* Character and movement needs to be added
* Enemy movement needs to be updated so that the enemies turn around correctly.
* Collision detection needs to be implemented.
